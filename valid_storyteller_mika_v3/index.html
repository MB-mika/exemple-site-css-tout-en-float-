                    transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his
                    head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff

                    in the living room that was used by everyone,
                    and so the door to this room was often kept
                    closed in the evening. But Gregor found it
                    easy to give up having the door open, he had,
                    after all, often failed to make use of it when it
                    was open and, without the family having noticed it,
                    lain in his room in its darkest corner. One time,
                    though, the charwoman left the door.
